This tiny pcb houses bq24302a chip which has power path managment and battery charging 
functionality.
Having this we are saving people pain of connecting/disconnecting battery, we ensure
continuity of operation and we are able to sustain real time clock. I think it's worthy

Chip has quite some options and for sake of completness most of them are available, thus
it might cause bit of pain when getting it work. Here is few notes:

1) If you are certain that you don't need thermistor to measure battery's temperature,
   then you need 10kOhm resistors on P_TEMP port.

   Though watch out with these fockers, they tend to not have insulation on wires. If you 
   short them charging won't be possible.

2) Control signals (PSEL, ISET2, CE) have on PCB resistors footprints allowing to pull/push
   them to GND or VUSB. If USB is not present, the one pulled high will obviously float.
   But no worries, they only control logic responsible for USB/AC charging, thus
   no bad should happen.
   I actually expect inputs on chip to have pull ups/downs to set them to default configuration
   when not conntected. Hopefully.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have done test of this device, and seems to work fine. It smoothly changes supply between
battery and USB. Tests were done with 5V power supply plugged as USB source, 370Ohm resistor 
plugged as a load for output. 
Battery was practically full when I did tests, so the charging test was limited. 
Nevertheless after a while the circuit started charging the battery with about 45mA and slowly
dropping to 0mA (fully charged I guess).

Since there is always something to improve, here is such TODO list:
1) After all, larger holes for connectors
2) Main chip easily can have smaller footprint
