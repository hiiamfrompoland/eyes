I have tried to move code interfacing with Sensor Fusion but it seems it's too much for Arduino Pro Mini.
No surprise actually. I am trying to reduce amount of code necessary, but since we require
also SDcard, buzzer and preferably BT it might be too much. 

Perhaps we will have to move to other microchip (like, stay with teensy).

So, yes it fits. Even with float arithmetics. Though I had to remove most of the initialization
code, thus we rather hope that everytime it works (it should) but if something fails we have
no means of knowing that.

The basic version of the device could work with simply replacing FTDI below with SDcard, 
but we might try to do better.
