We have nice and easy BT module Bluetooth Mate Gold. It's actually more like
serial bridge over Bluetooth. What is nice because it's easy. 

I tried the module with Teensy 3.0. 
What I learned:
	1) sparkfun recommends to change baudrate to 9600 between BT and Teensy,
	though I found that actually 115200 works better. To be honest I could
	get it to work with baudrate 9600

	2) Also I had problem with Serial2 on Teensy, thus I settled on using Serial1

	3) Windows (and maybe linux also) may see two com ports due to one connected BT
	device. In my case, the real one turned out to be the second one, not the first
	one. I don't know reason for that.

Thus connection is as easy as it gets:

Teensy		Bluetooth
0		TX-I
1		RX-O
3.3V		VCC
GND		GND
-		RTS-O (floating)
-		CTS-I (floating)

BTW1	For playing with few serial monitors open on Windows I recommend YAT software, it's
	really really nice
