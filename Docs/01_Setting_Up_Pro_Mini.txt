To get started with pro mini the easiest is to follow https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoProMini
in particular the option with using FTDI 3V3 board. 

However, this may fail. It is possible that sketch for Arduino won't upload at all. 
That is because bootloader on the Arduino Pro Mini itself might be missing - it could
be overwritten by someone or not written in factory to start with. 

If so, then we need to use external programmer. I have tried with USBasp and AVR Pocket Programmer.
USBasp might have problem that firmware is old enough to fail to communicate. We would have to flash
new firmware. 

AVR Pocket Programmer, on Windows, requires drivers that you can download here:
https://github.com/sparkfun/Pocket_AVR_Programmer/tree/master/Drivers
Plug the device. 
Actually Windows 7+ might try to download driver by itself, but it's most likely going to fail.
Then you need to find Device Manager, find your unknown device, right click to update/install new driver.
Then you will be asked whether to download or to find on computer, you click the second option. And 
browse to location of downloaded and unzipped driver. Let the installation finish, then unplug and plug device.
And should be fine!

For Linux, if you are using Linux, you should be smart enough to figure it out on your own in no time.

Now back to Arduino IDE, choose proper board, set programmer to USBtinyISP and Upload using programmer!
Yay.

If you wish to use some time in future option with programming using FTDI, you can also Tools>Burn Bootloader 
right now. 

Cheers.
