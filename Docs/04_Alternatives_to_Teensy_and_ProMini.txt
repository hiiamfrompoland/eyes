Both boards are actually few years old, and despite they serve well, it might be worthy
to consider changing to another system.

Here is few worthy mentioning:

1)  	NUCLEO-L432KC
	Size of Teensy, very powerful uC with FPU, up to 80MHz, with plenty of I2C and SPIs (awesome!),
	and power consumption of 84uA/MHz, so at max freq it would be comparable power consumption
	to Pro Mini with waaaaaay more possibilities.

	And damn, it does have RTC!

2) 	mbed HRM1017
	Nucle board, size of Teensy pretty much, with nRF51822, so built-in BT connectivity.
	And power consumption of about 2mA with advertasing.
	I guess there is little processing power, but it is not important.

3)	Teensy LC
	Power consumption about 6mA, 48MHz Cortex-M0+, 128kB flash, 18kB SRAM

4)	Teensy 3.2
	It's pretty much the same as Teensy 3.0 power-consumption-wise.
