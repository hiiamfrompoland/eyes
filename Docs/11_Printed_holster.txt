So there is this orange thingy that holds all small pcb's battery and everything alltogether.
It's quite nice for the moment being I think, though I believe better would be in future to
move everything on single PCB rendering this holster obsolete.

Though if you are determined to keep it, then there is few things I think need to be improved:
1) I didn't spend much time thinking how to guide wires between pcb, right now it's mess. 
   They must be carried in much smarter manner.
   
2) Battery Managment PCB has wires soldered after putting into place, that is not good. 
   If you solder before putting, then it's not possible to slide it into slot.
   Either change PCB design or change holster design to resolve that.

3) Distance between two parallel pcb's can be reduced. 

4) In general 3d printing on Zortrax gives quite solid and durable forms, so all walls/beams
   /supports can be thinned a bit to save on space

5) Notch for PCB's is perhaps too deep. PCB solder points are not exposed that well because of them

6) It's missing place to put a button

7) Wires are way to dangly

8) Perhaps it would be nice to house battery connector
