Top priority: working, reliable, accurate prototype in plastic case.

9	Review quaternions/pitches/rolls, as device head-mounted on patients temple eg pitch needs to reflect this (priority 1). Also having a yaw output would be nice.

2	Replace openlog with something normal like just a SD card (priority 1)

5	Verify accuracy of the device measurement (priority 1)

7	Of great use would a button to turn on/off actually the device completly. (priority 1) 
        For instance something like 40mA capable switch between Battery Manager output to VIN to Teensy.

Secondary priority

4	Get Buzzer to work finally (priority 2)

Tertiary priority

6	Find out if selftest result is anyhow our concern (priority 3)

3	Get real time clock (RTC) to work (priority 3)

8	For the 3dprinted holster and assembly, these should be fixed: (priority 3)
	1) I didn't spend much time thinking how to guide wires between pcb, right now it's mess. 
   	They must be carried in much smarter manner.
   
	2) Battery Managment PCB has wires soldered after putting into place, that is not good. (priority 2)
  	If you solder before putting, then it's not possible to slide it into slot.
   	Either change PCB design or change holster design to resolve that.

	3) Distance between two parallel pcb's can be reduced. (priority 3)

	4) In general 3d printing on Zortrax gives quite solid and durable forms, so all walls/beams (priority 3)
	   /supports can be thinned a bit to save on space

	5) Notch for PCB's is perhaps too deep. PCB solder points are not exposed that well because of them (priority 3)

	7) Wires are way to dangly (priority 3)

	8) Perhaps it would be nice to house battery connector (priority 3)

	6) It's missing place to put a button
